            <p>Hola Dear Visitors!</p>
            <br>
            <p>Welcome to my portfolio Web site! </p>
            <br>
            <p> I am a passionate web developer dedicated to creating a safe online environment. 
                As a motivated student, I strive to provide excellent services. This portfolio showcases my expertise, growth, and commitment. 
                My skills expand in various areas, including programming, web development, graphic design, and writing. 
                I had actively sought opportunities to expand my skill sets and broaden perspectives and 
                had taken on challenges and continuously learn to stay ahead in technology cause I believe there is always a room for learning. 
                This living portfolio reflects all of my ongoing development and aspirations.</p>

                It's through our mistakes and setbacks that we learn, grow, and ultimately achieve greatness." -Jonah Mae</p>
